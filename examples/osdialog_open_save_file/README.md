#osdialog

This example works very well on Windows, but fails on MacOS.

MacOS wants to assume you have an application window, where as this example runs from the terminal.

Apparently is runs fine when you use it in a Windowed application. See this [github issue](https://github.com/AndrewBelt/osdialog/issues/18). In my own testing in Windowed apps on Mac it still fails. Not recommeded.
