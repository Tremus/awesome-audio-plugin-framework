# Examples

The goal is to create a large folder of example code showcasing the use of the libraries listed in this repos root directory.

The example code should use as few dependancies as possible to make it easy to copy/paste build config & code into users own projects.

The example would include things like:

-   Widgets: sliders, buttons, scrollable lists & tables, single & multi line text input, dropdown menus, tooltips
-   Reading / writing / searching files
