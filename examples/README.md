# Examples

TODO

The goal is to create a large folder of example code using the libraries that can showcase their usage. The example code (ideally) should use as few dependancies as possible to make it easy to integrate into other projects.

The example would include things like:

-   Widgets: sliders, buttons, scrollable lists & tables, single & multi line text input, dropdown menus, tooltips
-   Reading / writing / searching files
-   Making GET & POST HTTPS requests

Eventually this could be catalogued here so that users could search the page for "file dialogue box", and this markdown would link them to the relevant code that just does that one thing.
